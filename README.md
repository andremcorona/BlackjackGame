Welcome to my Blackjack Game!

I have created this command line gamme of Blackjack with the goal of:
1. Putting my python skills to the test.
2. Build a game that I can play from the command line and eventually enhance.
3. Creating something I would actually enjoy playing.

I will be maintaining this project for as long as I can. Feel free to use this code 
as a template to make your own.
